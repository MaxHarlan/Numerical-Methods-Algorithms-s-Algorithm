Max Harlan - LU Decomposition
This is a fucntion that uses the LU Factorization solve a system of
equations for unknown variable.
A will be the only input value as a system of eqautions values in matrix
form.
The outputs will be L, the lower triangular matrix, U, the upper
triangular matirx, and P, the pivot matrix

Inputs:

  A = Square Matrix
  
Outputs:

  P = Pivot Matrix

  L = Lower Matrix
  
  U = Upper Matrix
